Wondering...
===========

1. Do they have to be real location and real spp.?
  1. Maybe the composition of the different categories (patterns according to which the spp. distribute) should be realistic? 
2. Coocurrence btween spp.? Mutually exclusive? 
  1. I have seen cases where two spp. shares the same niche, and we find only one or the other, not both. 
3. Anything for financial resources? 
4. Other scribbles (not exactly sure what I meant...)
  1. What about making a funcion? 
  2. Coenoclines vs. accuracy on each sp. distribution
  3. Which statistical methods to test? 
    1. Multi-model approach? 
    2. "Correlation-like" structures among the different methods? 

Sources of randomisation
=======================

1. Parameterisation of the abundance/distribution functions (meta-/supra- functions). Mobile vs. stationary?
2. Spatial distibution
3. Abundance in each grid
4. Chances in finding the sp. that is set to be present
5. Patterns of environmental gradientnts
  1. real / artificial (orthogonal, covaried)

There are several levels of randomisation and hence the possibilities for repetition. Somehow we need to be simplify. 

Other notes
==========

- spp. dependent on envirnomental gradients (stationary/mobile). True? Then significance on the environmental gradients on which the sp. depends on. 
  - dependent on one gradient? 
  - combinations of gradients? 
- spp. __not__ dependent on the env'l gradients (at least not within the study area limit)
- noise or "diluter" (stationary/mobile): __True__ means _non-significance_
